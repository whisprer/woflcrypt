 an encrypt/decrypt pair i created very early on as a learning exercise


2408252158

a project that was damn near my first real scfipt written not read, just a pair of bits of code to perform encrypt/decrypt. it slowly grew until i tried to reverse a triple XOR and discovered i'd coem to a total standstill because... triple XOR isnt reversible. oop.

anyways, here's the entire catalogue of attempts and fails, rich with innovation and creativity - some wild goosechases/rabitholes and red herrings but mostly total fails. nevertheless there's  heccuva lot of inspiration for futre projects buried in the depths ofall this python - take a peek and see what you can find, if you dare....


- near every inch of this project is written in Python an it's using a lot of basic math libs to support it - nothing remotely obscure and weird tho, it's just stuff like numpy and mostly math like basic logic or arithmetic tbh.
- it does spiral a bit big in palces but compared to more recent projects it's tiny at a mere few hundred lines
- you'll find every single thing needed commented in the various files although there'ss basically zero documentation. it wasn't really done at a time when i onsidered others, it was just me learning basics.


you'll please sympathise that at one point i had only a bronken ms surface to code on and so was using a mouse to click keys on the 'on-screen' keyborad, incredibly slow painful laborious and paistaking task that resulted in me developing a bad case of "the claw" after many hrs.

so this is just an update to say i've tidied up an read a lil jus tto see what's what. it seems tho there's a research paper about reverse engoineering laplace transformed encryptions n stuff, this is neertheless unrelated as yet and is simply a vvery early Python learning exercise where i tried to make a v simple ecrytpiion program absed on XORing two hexcode strings.
